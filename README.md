# Helical
Helical is a 16-voice polyphonic Autoregressive Algorithmic Synthesizer.  
With Autoregressive Synthesis/Sequence, it continuously generates new phrases.  
Each of the 16 voices consists of a sequencer, wavetable oscillator, envelope generator, and VCA.  
Users can change the scale and LED color with a dedicated editor, and wavetables can be modified using Synthesis Technology's WaveEdit.

# Autoregressive Synthesis/Sequence
Autoregressive Synthesis/Sequence is an original method that refers to its past parameters to determine the next parameters.  
In Helical, the past pitch of each oscillator affects the next duration, and the past duration affects the next pitch. By connecting to the past in a helical relationship, the sound is not completely random, but rather generates an organic sound.

New pitch and duration calculations when the envelope reaches its end.

The progression of autoregression generates the envelope and pitch flow shown in the figure above.

Helical is designed to generate new rhythms beyond existing music theory by calculating duration independent of tempo and BPM. (It is possible to synchronize to an external clock by using the Poly function.)

# Controls
### Poly
* Set the polyphony of each Arc/Orbit output from 0 to 8.   
Lowering the Poly setting rapidly does not immediately silence the sound; the unit processing stops when each unit's envelope reaches end. When raising the Poly, the envelope starts when the unit turns on, allowing synchronization with an external clock by setting the knob to 0 and inputting a Clock signal into Poly CV in.

### Root
* Set the root note. V/OCT tracking may become unstable outside the 1-5V range.
### Scale
* Sets the scale to be used. You can change the wavetable preset by turning the knob while pressing the encoder in.

### Glide
* Set the transition time when changing to the next pitch. Applies to all pitch changes, including changes in Scale and Root.

### Spread
* Set the width of change when converting from duration to pitch. With CCW, the pitch becomes only Root, and with CW, it changes from the frequency of Root to G9 (12543.9Hz).

### Wave
* Morphing Wavetables within a preset. Interpolation between wavetables is performed, allowing smooth transitions between tables.

### Helicity
* Determines the multiplier when converting from pitch to duration.  
The duration is determined by (âˆšpitch) * Helical, with a change range of 0.002-300 times.

### Env
* Sets the ratio of attack and decay for the envelope.  
At both edges of the knob, the curve changes from linear to log curve.  
Envelope changes are not applied until the envelope reaches its end.

### re(L)oad / (R)eload
* Forcibly recalculates the parameters for each Unit in the Arc and Orbit channels.  
Regardless of the number of polyphonies, the duration and pitch of all units are recalculated.  
Patching 5V Gate enables external control.

### Lock
* Even when the envelope reaches end, the duration and pitch are not recalculated, and the current state is looped.   
Patching the 5V Gate will lock when the Gate is HIGH.

# Wavetable Edit
Synthesis Technology's <a href="https://synthtech.com/waveedit/">Wave Edit</a> can be used to create original presets of wavetables.  
Rename the exported wav file to buf_wt.wav and write it to the SD card.

<img src="ManualData/WaveEdit.jpg" width="100%">  

As described above, each of the 8 tables is processed as a single preset on Helical.  


For more information on how to use Wave Edit, please refer to the  <a href="https://synthtech.com/waveedit/">SynthsisTechnology page</a>.  

If you are using other software, please create a wav file with a table size of 256sample, 64 types, total 16384samle, and rename it buf_wt.wav and write it to the SD card.  
48kHz/24bit is recommended.

# Scale Edit
Please refer to the pdf included with the Helical Scale Editor.
